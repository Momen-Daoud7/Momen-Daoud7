## üí° What I Love to Do

- Using my programming knowledge to solve problems
- Exploring AI technologies and their potential applications
- Watching tech content

## üöÄ My Experiences

- 2022: I started my professional journey as a frontend engineer at Innovation Gate (Saudi Startup accelerator)
- 2023: I started a new role in the healthcare industry as a React developer at Circles
- Mid-2023 - present: Due to the war situation in my country, I lost my job. I then found a new healthcare startup in the UK that was interested in me, so I joined them and now lead the product as a full-stack engineer

## üåü Core Beliefs

- **Coding less is more**: I believe our job as software engineers is solving problems, not just coding. Investing time in understanding the problem and thinking of multiple possible solutions is better than just taking the requirements and starting to code without actually understanding what's going on
- **Continuous Learning**: Our field is rapidly changing, especially with AI. If you miss three months, you're out of work
- **Fundamentals are everything**: Everything is abstract, whether it's a framework (Nestjs, Django) or library (React). Investing time in understanding the fundamentals will get you into the top 1%
